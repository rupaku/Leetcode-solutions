'''
Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

        num = head.val
        while head.next:
            # update resu by shifting by one to left and add curr val
            num = (num << 1) | head.next.val
            head=head.next
        return num
